# Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem with Graph Neural Networks

> üß† Master's thesis project | üîç Research meets Engineering

This project combines **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** with **Integer Linear Programming (ILP)** to learn heuristics for the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**. It leverages **PyTorch Geometric** for graph-based deep learning and **SciPy** for exact optimization to create an end-to-end ML pipeline.

By generating optimal TSP solutions via ILP, this work trains a GNN model to approximate those solutions efficiently, bridging classical optimization with modern machine learning.

### üßÆ Integer Linear Programming (ILP) Solver
The tsp/solver.py module formulates the TSP as an ILP problem solved using scipy.optimize.linprog. It generates optimal TSP tours that serve as labeled ground truth for supervised GNN training.

Key features:

- Formulates subtour elimination constraints(Branch & Cut) to ensure valid tours

- Solves optimally for small to medium-sized TSP instances

- Provides edge-level labels for GNN training targets

### üß† Graph Neural Network (GNN) Model
Implemented in gnn/model.py, this GNN leverages PyTorch Geometric to learn from graphs labeled by the ILP solver.

The model is designed to predict which edges in a fully connected graph belong to the optimal TSP tour, using both node and edge-level features.

üîç Architecture Overview
Node Encoder: Projects raw node indices into an embedding space

Edge Encoder: Encodes Euclidean distances (edge weights)

Core GNN: Two stacked GATConv layers (Graph Attention Networks)

Output: Edge classification (probability of being part of the optimal tour)

‚úÖ Highlights
Processes fully connected graphs representing TSP nodes

Relies on learned embeddings for nodes and distances for edges

Learns to predict edges belonging to the optimal tour

Attempts efficient approximate inference on unseen graphs
